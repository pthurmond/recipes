## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. **Heat the base:**
    In a large skillet over medium heat, warm **2 tbsp oil**. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant — about **1 minute**. [Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/a45457114/tuscan-white-bean-skillet-recipe/)
2. **Cook the veggies:**
    Add cherry tomatoes, season with **1/2 tsp salt**, and cook, tossing occasionally, until they soften and release juices — about **3–4 minutes**. Add spinach and cook until wilted — about **1–2 minutes**. [Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/a45457114/tuscan-white-bean-skillet-recipe/)
3. **Build the sauce:**
    Stir in cannellini beans, heavy cream, Parmesan, the **remaining 1/2 tsp salt**, and **1/4 cup water**. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and creamy — about **8–12 minutes**. (Sauce will thicken more as it cools.)
