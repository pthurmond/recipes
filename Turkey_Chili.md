# Turkey Chili Recipe
This is my famous Turkey Chili recipe. I created it in 2009 or 2010 for a chili cookoff at work. Warning, it is a touch sweet, but also very hot for those that are sensitive to spicey food. Adjust the amount and type of peppers (and whether or not you keep the seeds) to your tastes. You can substitue Poblano Peppers that are only a whiff spicier than Green Peppers, but taste great smoked.

The slightly sweet, cinnamon-laced flavor lead to a friend dubbing it "Christmas Chili".

### Recipe Ingredients (for the huge pot of chili I made, I left some at home so you didn’t see it all):

- 6 pounds of lean ground turkey (80/20)
- 4 cans of Great Value (Wal-Mart brand) Chili Beans
- 1 diced onion
- 1 ½ cups of Splenda
- 2 Jars of Garden Fresh brand Salsa (I have only found this at CostCo so far) – Medium Heat (only one they have there)
- Corn meal or corn muffin mix (added to thicken chili and soften the spicyness)
- Cumin
- Cinnamon
- Chili Powder
- Garlic Powder
- Garlic Cloves (I used about ¼ clove along with the Garlic Powder, but spice to your taste)
- 4 Jalapeno peppers w/seeds - diced into very small pieces
- 4 Serrano peppers w/seeds – diced into very small pieces
- 6 Habanero peppers w/seeds – diced into very small pieces
- 2 or 3 tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive oil (if needed to keep the meat from burning to the sides, mostly for extra extra lean meat 90%+)
 

### To Prepare this:

In a large pot cook just the meat on medium until it is lightly brown throughout. As it is cooking break it up into small bits or clumps, don’t leave large chunks otherwise the meat won’t absorb the flavor fully. Add olive oil if 90% lean or higher. Once the meat is ready add the chili beans and lower heat to Medium-Low. Don’t forget to stir often and thoroughly. Let it cook another 5 minutes then add the salsa, onion, hot peppers, and garlic. Cook for another 5 minutes.

Now start adding the spices (except the Splenda) to your taste. I did this liberally and based on taste and experience cooking so I don’t know exactly how much I used of each, but the Cumin, Cinnamon, and Chili Powder each probably had at least 2 tablespoons. To get it to taste add then stir for at least a minute before tasting then add more as you see fit. Cumin adds a lot of the flavor, Chili powder is in the middle, and the Cinnamon is pretty weak in the chili, so add liberally. Add corn meal or corn muffin mix until you are happy with the thickness of your chili. Remember, this will soften the spiciness a bit. Let it cook for another 15 – 20 minutes, then add the Splenda and change the temperature to Low. Let it simmer for anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes. Then remove from heat. Remember to stir often and thoroughly.

The longer you cook it the more the flavor will mix and be enhanced. If you add a small amount of vinegar it will amplify the spicy a bit. You can serve right away, but for best flavor results let it sit in the fridge overnight.
