# Instant Pot Hummus



---

### Recipe Ingredients:

#### Beans
- 1 pound dried garbanzo beans rinsed
- 12 cups of water

#### Hummus
- 3 cups cooked garbanzo beans still warm
- 1 1/2 cups warm bean cooking liquid
- 1/4 cup tahini
- 6 medium cloves garlic
- 2 to 3 large lemon juiced (to taste)
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil highest quality
- 1 tablespoon of saracha sauce (won't make it spicy)


### To Prepare this:

TO COOK THE BEANS:
1. Rinse garbanzo beans and discard any stones. Place in Instant Pot insert along with 12 cups of filtered water.
2. Close lid, make sure vent is set to "sealed" and set Instant Pot to manual for 35 minutes.
3. Allow Instant Pot to naturally release pressure when done (this can take up to 1/2 hour). If you are pressed for time, allow IP to release pressure naturally for at least 15 minutes and then do a slow quick pressure release.
4. Carefully drain the beans, making sure to reserve the liquid!

HUMMUS:
1. Transfer 3 cups of warm drained, cooked garbanzo beans to the bowl of food processor fitted with the chopping blade. Add all other ingredients EXCEPT olive oil.
2. Process until smooth and slowly add the olive in through the tube, 1 T at a time.
3. Hummus should be smooth, creamy and taste almost whipped.
4. Serve topped with Za'atar, smoked paprika and a splash of olive oil and Enjoy!
