# Sourdough Bread



---

## Ingredients
- 75g active starter (yeast that is well fed and doing a cha cha)
- 350g water at room temperature
- 500g bread flour (can also use all purpose flour)
- 2 tsp salt


## Instructions
Do each of these things in this order.

### Making The Dough
1. Mix the starter and water, stir until fully dissolved.
2. Add the salt, dissolve into the mix.
3. Add the flour
4. Mix thoroughly. It will be sticky and messy.
5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a shower cap and let rest for 60 minutes.

### Kneading The Dough
1. After the rest, lift a corner of the dough. Pulling across and fold onto the other side.
2. Do this pulling and folding all the way around the bowl 20 to 25 times.
3. Cover the bowl again.
4. Do the same lifting and folding 2 to 4 more times over the next 4 hours. Doing 10 to 15 pulls each time.
5. Cover again, let it rest and rise at room temperature for 8 to 10 hours (or overnight).
6. It should grow during this rest period.

### Proofing The Dough
1. Next, dust a proofing basket with rice flour to prevent sticking (you can use normal flour, but that can cause cooking results problems).
2. Perform a single round of lifting, pulling, and folding. Bring into a loose ball.
3. Lift or gently tilt the ball of dough into the proofing basket.
4. Cover the bowl with plastic.
5. Chill a minimum of 3 hours in the refrigerator and up to 3 days. The longer it sits in the fridge the stronger the "sour" flavor.


### Baking The Dough
1. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Ferenheit.
2. Lay out a sheet of parchment paper that is wider than your ball of dough.
3. Sprinkle rice flour (or regular flour, but rice flour is better) on the parchment paper.
4. Invert the proofing basket onto the parchment paper.
5. Score the top of the dough (your choice of pattern).
6. Use the parchment paper to lower the dough into a baking roaster pan.
7. Bake in the oven for 40 minutes for a softer crust. Up to 50 minutes for a crispy crust.
