Calories: 479 calories

## Ingredients
- 2 lbs chicken cutlets or boneless skinless breasts (cut to about half an inch thick)
- 1 tsp salt (add more to taste)
- 1 tbsp fresh ground pepper (add more to taste)
- 1 sprig fresh minced rosemary
- 2 tbsp italian seasoning
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 1 cup grated/zested parmesan cheese
- 2 eggs
- 1.5 cups panko bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup olive oil for frying, and more as needed

## Instructions
1. Cut chicken breasts to size. Set aside.
2. Set out three bowls, and in the first bowl add the zested parmesan cheese, then the eggs in the second bowl, and the panko bread crumbs in the third.
3. Strip the leaves from the fresh rosemary sprig and mince them finely with a knife. Add the minced rosemary to the egg bowl, then whisk the eggs and rosemary together until combined.
4. In the third bowl, add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasoning to the bread crumbs. Mix thoroughly.
5. Heat up a large skillet over medium heat, and let it heat up while you bread the chicken.
6. First dip each chicken cutlet into the parmesan, shake off the excess, then dip into the egg, then let the excess drip off, then finally dip into the panko bread crumbs (shaking off prevents our breading from falling off later).
7. When the pan is nice and hot, add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan, about 2-3 tbsp.
8. Add 3 or 4 chicken cutlets to the hot oil (do not crowd the chicken cutlets)
9. Add more salt and pepper to the exposed side.
10. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, adding more salt and pepper to the first side down when you flip, until lightly golden and crispy. If the bread crumbs are browning too quickly, you can turn the heat down.
11. Once a side is cooked, sprinkle more parmesan on the cooked side. If this is the first cooked side, don't forget to add more salt and pepper.
12. After the second side is cooked, flip to have the additional parmesan cook for another 30 to 60 seconds. Adding parmesan to the second side. Then flip again so that both sides have additional parmesan cooked into it.
13. Ensure your chicken reaches 165 degrees.
14. Repeat with the remaining cutlets, and enjoy!
